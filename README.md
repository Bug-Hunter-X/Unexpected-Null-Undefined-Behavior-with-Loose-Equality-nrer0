# Unexpected Null/Undefined Behavior with Loose Equality in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to the loose equality operator (`==`) and null/undefined checks.  The issue arises when comparing values of different types, leading to unexpected results and potentially difficult-to-debug errors.

## The Problem
The code in `bug.js` demonstrates the faulty comparison.  Loose equality can lead to false positives when checking for null.  For instance, `null == undefined` evaluates to `true`, but `null === undefined` is `false`.

## The Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` uses strict equality (`===`) to address the issue. Strict equality checks both the value and the type, eliminating the unintended comparisons that lead to the error.
